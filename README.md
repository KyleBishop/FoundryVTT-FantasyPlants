# FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants
A module that includes over 600 fantasy plants from Broderick's Compendium: Plants and Fungi Across the Realm (version 2.0) (Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/83oupp/brodericks_compendium_plants_and_fungi_across_the/ ). I did not create any of the plants. This addon includes rolltables for Arctic, City, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Ocean, Plains, River, Swamp, and Underdark/Cave regions as per the source material.

Roll tables and plants are included as compendiums. Open up the roll table and select the region type your party is searching in. Results will be added to a "Found Plants" loot actor for distribution to the players.
