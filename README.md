# FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants
A module that includes over 600 fantasy plants from Broderick's Compendium: Plants and Fungi Across the Realm (version 2.0) (Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/83oupp/brodericks_compendium_plants_and_fungi_across_the/ ). I did not create any of the plants. This addon includes rolltables for the following regions as per the source material: 
* Arctic 
* City 
* Coastal 
* Desert 
* Forest
* Jungle 
* Mountain 
* Ocean 
* Plains 
* River 
* Swamp 
* Underdark/Cave

Roll tables and plants are included as compendiums. Open up the roll table and select the region type your party is searching in. Results will be added to a "Found Plants" loot actor for distribution to the players.

# Suggested Use #
I currently use this in my campaign to alloy players to forage. If you use the included roll tables for the region(s) they are in, you can select Generate Loot on the table, it will create a new instance of the item on the Actor "Found Plants" in the Actors tab (it will create that loot actor if you don't have it already). 

I also have Forien's Unidentified Items add-on and right click the new plant and mystify before letting the players see it/access it. You can save a copy to your items for reference if you want.
